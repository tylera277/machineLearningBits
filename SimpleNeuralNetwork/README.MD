Simple neural network used in identifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. Consists of an input layer, two hidden layers and an output layer.
The two hidden layers each have 32 neurons. After training through the 50,000 samples, my program got ~93% accuracy on predicting the digits in the 10,000 sample test set.

Future improvement: This program needs to be written more OOP than how it is right now.
